A project than I have been doing for a week now indented for school project but hopefully it grow and stands on its own legs.

## Getting Started
Anyone fork form this project and send pr

### Tools we've been using
Currently I have only been doing design related stuff so I have used a lot http://flexboxgrid.com/ to create responsive pages. I hopefully I will move later on to bootstrap. Bootstrap is imported in this project however I have only used for navigation that's. This was intentional



### Style guidelines on visual page:
This is important so I have tried a lot to make it look javascript esk, than means I have to follow a certain color palette

### Layout on the pages:
A column based grid as been my preferred layout method at times I have used flexbox to center things which is okay!




### How we work in github:
If you see a bug please report it by filing an issue

**Happy coding, over and out.**
